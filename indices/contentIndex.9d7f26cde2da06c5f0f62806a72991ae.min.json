Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn‚Äôt blinded. At the end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n---\n\n## block quote\n\n \u003e \n \u003e CHARACTER NAME -- \"this is a quote that a character said out loud to the audience\n\n````\n\u003e CHARACTER NAME -- \"this is a quote that a character said out loud to the audience\n````\n\n---\n\n# Header 1\n\n## header 2\n\n### header 3\n\n````\n# header 1\n## header 2\n### header 3\n...\n````\n\n---\n\n# Line Break\n\n````\ninvisiable line break\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\nvisible line break\n---\n````\n\n---\n\n# List\n\n* one \n* two\n  * 2.1\n  * 2.2\n* three\n\n````\n- one\n- two\n\t- 2.1\n\t- 2.2\n- three\n````\n\n---\n\n# Table\n\n### md\n\n|header|description|\n|------|-----------|\n|num  1|one|\n|num 2|two|\n|num 3|three|\n\n````\n| header | description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| num 1  | one         |\n| num 2  | two         |\n| num 3  | three       |\n````\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-30T22:51:20.109961538-05:00","tags":null},"/Tuts/Navigation":{"title":"","content":"\n# Navigation\n\nnavigate previous and next note link\n`ctrl + alt + arrow L R`\n\ntoggle preview / editor mode \n`ctrl + tab`\n\nI want to link notes but I don't want to clutter the graph\n\n````\n* right click doc \"Copy Obsidian URL\"\n* paste\n\n[Pretty Name](\u003cURL\u003e)\n````\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-30T22:51:20.113961457-05:00","tags":null},"/Tuts/dice-rolling":{"title":"","content":"\n# dice rolling\n\nExamples\n`dice: 1d2` \n`dice: 3d4 + 3`  \n`dice: 1d12 + 1d10 + 5`  `dice: 3d4+3d4-(3d4 * 1d4) - 2^1d7` \n\n`dice: 1d2`\n`dice: 1d20`\n`dice: 1d20+5`\n`dice: 1d6+2`\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-30T22:51:20.113961457-05:00","tags":null}}
